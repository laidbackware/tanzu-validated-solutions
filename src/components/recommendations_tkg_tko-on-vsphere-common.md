### Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Clusters Recommendations

|**Decision ID**|**Design Decision**|**Design Justification**|**Design Implications**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|TKO-TKG-001|Deploy TKG management cluster from TKG installer UI.|Simplified method of installation|<p>When you deploy a management cluster by using the installer interface, it populates a cluster configuration file for the management cluster with the required parameters. </p><p></p><p>You can use the configuration file as a model for future deployments from the CLI.</p>|
|TKO-TKG-002|Register management cluster with Tanzu Mission Control (TMC).|Tanzu Mission Control automates the creation of the Tanzu Kubernetes clusters and manages the life cycle of all clusters centrally.|Tanzu Mission Control also automates the deployment of Tanzu packages in all Tanzu Kubernetes clusters associated with TMC.|
|TKO-TKG-003|Use NSX Advanced Load Balancer as your control plane endpoint provider and for application load balancing.|Eliminates the requirement for an external load balancer and additional configuration changes on your Tanzu Kubernetes Grid clusters.|NSX ALB is a true SDN solution, and it offers a flexible deployment model and automated way of scaling load balancer objects when needed.|
|TKO-TKG-004|Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes clusters in large form factor.|Allow TKG clusters integration with Tanzu SaaS components (Tanzu Mission Control, Tanzu Observability, and Tanzu Service Mesh).|<p>When TKG is integrated with SaaS endpoints, new pods or services are created in the target cluster and the pods have specific CPU requirements which canâ€™t be fulfilled with medium and small-sized control plane or worker nodes.</p><p></p>|
|TKO-TKG-005|Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes clusters with Prod plan.|This deploys multiple control plane nodes and provides high availability for the control plane.|TKG infrastructure is not impacted by a single node failure. |
|TKO-TKG-006|Enable identity management for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid clusters.|To avoid usage of administrator credentials and ensure that required users with right roles have access to Tanzu Kubernetes Grid clusters.|<p>Pinniped package helps with integrating TKG management cluster with LDAPS or OIDC Authentication.</p><p></p><p>Workload cluster inherits the authentication configuration from the management cluster.</p>|
|TKO-TKG-007|Enable Machine Health Checks for TKG clusters.|vSphere HA and Machine Health Checks interoperably work together to enhance workload resiliency.|A MachineHealthCheck is a resource within the Cluster API which allows users to define conditions under which machines within a cluster should be considered unhealthy. Remediation actions can be taken when MachineHealthCheck has identified a node as unhealthy.|
|TKO-TKG-008|Use Photon based image for TKG clusters.|TMC supports only Photon-based images for deploying TKG clusters.|Provisioning clusters from TMC with Ubuntu or any custom images is still in development.|
