## Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Components

VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) provides organizations with a consistent, upstream-compatible, regional Kubernetes substrate that is ready for end-user workloads and ecosystem integrations. You can deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid across software-defined datacenters (SDDC) and public cloud environments, including vSphere, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon EC2.

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid comprises the following components:

**Management Cluster -** A management cluster is the first element that you deploy when you create a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance. The management cluster is a Kubernetes cluster that performs the role of the primary management and operational center for the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance. The management cluster is purpose-built for operating the platform and managing the lifecycle of Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.

**Cluster API -** Tanzu Kubernetes Grid functions through the creation of a management Kubernetes cluster which houses [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/). The Cluster API then interacts with the infrastructure provider to service workload Kubernetes cluster lifecycle requests.

**Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster -** Tanzu Kubernetes clusters are the Kubernetes clusters in which your application workloads run. These clusters are also referred to as workload clusters. Tanzu Kubernetes clusters can run different versions of Kubernetes, depending on the needs of the applications they run.

**Shared Service Cluster -**  Each Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance can only have one shared services cluster. You will deploy this cluster only if you intend to deploy shared services such as Contour and Harbor.

**Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster Plans -** A cluster plan is a blueprint that describes the configuration with which to deploy a Tanzu Kubernetes cluster. It provides a set of configurable values that describe settings like the number of control plane machines, worker machines, VM types, and so on. This release of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid provides two default templates, dev and prod.

**Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Instance -** A Tanzu Kubernetes Grid instance is the full deployment of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, including the management cluster, the workload clusters, and the shared services cluster that you configure.

**Tanzu CLI -** A command-line utility that provides the necessary commands to build and operate Tanzu management and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters.

**Bootstrap Machine -** The bootstrap machine is the laptop, host, or server on which you download and run the Tanzu CLI. This is where the initial bootstrapping of a management cluster occurs before it is pushed to the platform where it will run.

**Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Installer -** The Tanzu Kubernetes Grid installer is a graphical wizard that you launch by running the `tanzu management-cluster create --ui` command. The installer wizard runs locally on the bootstrap machine and provides a user interface to guide you through the process of deploying a management cluster.
