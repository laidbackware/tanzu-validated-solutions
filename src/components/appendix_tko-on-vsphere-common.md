## <a id="appendix-a"></a> Appendix A - Configure Node Sizes
The Tanzu CLI creates the individual nodes of management clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes clusters according to the settings that you provide in the configuration file.

On vSphere, you can configure all node VMs to have the same predefined configurations, set different predefined configurations for control plane and worker nodes, or customize the configurations of the nodes. By using these settings, you can create clusters that have nodes with different configuration compared to the configuration of management cluster nodes. You can also create clusters in which the control plane nodes and worker nodes have different configuration.

### Use Predefined Node Configuration

The Tanzu CLI provides the following predefined configuration for cluster nodes:

|**Size**|**CPU**|**Memory (in GB)**|**Disk (in GB)**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Small|2|4|20|
|Medium|2|8|40|
|Large|4|16|40|
|Extra-large|8|32|80|

To create a cluster in which all of the control plane and worker node VMs are the same size, specify the `SIZE` variable. If you set the `SIZE` variable, all nodes will be created with the configuration that you set.

- `SIZE: "large"`

To create a cluster in which the control plane and worker node VMs are different sizes, specify the `CONTROLPLANE_SIZE` and `WORKER_SIZE` options.

- `CONTROLPLANE_SIZE: "medium"`
- `WORKER_SIZE: "large"`

You can combine the `CONTROLPLANE_SIZE` and `WORKER_SIZE` options with the `SIZE` option. For example, if you specify `SIZE: "large"` with `WORKER_SIZE: "extra-large"`, the control plane nodes will be set to large and worker nodes will be set to extra-large.

- `SIZE: "large"`
- `WORKER_SIZE: "extra-large"`

### Define Custom Node Configurations

You can customize the configuration of the nodes rather than using the predefined configurations.

To use the same custom configuration for all nodes, specify the `VSPHERE_NUM_CPUS`, `VSPHERE_DISK_GIB`, and `VSPHERE_MEM_MIB` options.

- `VSPHERE_NUM_CPUS: 2`
- `VSPHERE_DISK_GIB: 40`
- `VSPHERE_MEM_MIB: 4096`

To define different custom configurations for control plane nodes and worker nodes, specify the `VSPHERE_CONTROL_PLANE_*` and `VSPHERE_WORKER_*` options.

- `VSPHERE_CONTROL_PLANE_NUM_CPUS: 2`
- `VSPHERE_CONTROL_PLANE_DISK_GIB: 20`
- `VSPHERE_CONTROL_PLANE_MEM_MIB: 8192`
- `VSPHERE_WORKER_NUM_CPUS: 4`
- `VSPHERE_WORKER_DISK_GIB: 40`
- `VSPHERE_WORKER_MEM_MIB: 4096`

## <a id="appendix-b"></a> Appendix B - NSX Advanced Load Balancer Sizing Guidelines

### NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller Sizing Guidelines

Regardless of NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller configuration, each controller cluster can achieve up to 5000 virtual services, which is a hard limit. For further details,  refer to [Sizing Compute and Storage Resources for NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller(s)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/vcf-nsx-advanced-load-balancer-v1/GUID-0B159D7A-E9ED-4C3C-B959-AC09877D26CE.html).

|**Controller Size**|**VM Configuration**|**Virtual Services**|**Avi SE Scale**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Small|4 vCPUS, 12 GB RAM|0-50|0-10|
|Medium|8 vCPUS, 24 GB RAM|0-200|0-100|
|Large|16 vCPUS, 32 GB RAM|200-1000|100-200|
|Extra Large|24 vCPUS, 48 GB RAM|1000-5000|200-400|

### Service Engine Sizing Guidelines
For guidance on sizing your service engines (SEs), see [Sizing Compute and Storage Resources for NSX Advanced Load Balancer Service Engine(s)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/vcf-nsx-advanced-load-balancer-v1/GUID-149D3FFA-BF77-4B6F-B73D-A42D5375E9CF.html).

|**Performance metric**|**1 vCPU core**|
| --- | --- |
|Throughput|4 Gb/s|
|Connections/s|40k|
|SSL Throughput|1 Gb/s|
|SSL TPS (RSA2K)|~600|
|SSL TPS (ECC)|2500|

Multiple performance vectors or features may have an impact on performance.  For instance, to achieve 1 Gb/s of SSL throughput and 2000 TPS of SSL with EC certificates, NSX Advanced Load Balancer recommends two cores.

NSX Advanced Load Balancer SEs may be configured with as little as 1 vCPU core and 1 GB RAM, or up to 36 vCPU cores and 128 GB RAM. SEs can be deployed in Active/Active or Active/Standby mode depending on the license tier used. NSX Advanced Load Balancer Essentials license doesn’t support Active/Active HA mode for SE.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|TKO-ALB-SE-001|Configure the high availability mode for SEs.|To mitigate a single point of failure for the NSX Advanced Load Balancer data plane.|High availability for SEs is configured by setting the Elastic HA mode to Active/Active or N+M in the Service Engine Group.|
