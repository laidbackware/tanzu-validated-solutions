# VMware Tanzu for Kubernetes Operations on vSphere Reference Design

Tanzu for Kubernetes Operations simplifies operating Kubernetes for multi-cloud deployment by centralizing management and governance for clusters and teams across on-premises, public clouds, and edge. It delivers an open source aligned Kubernetes distribution with consistent operations and management to support infrastructure and app modernization.

This document describes a reference design for deploying VMware Tanzu for Kubernetes Operations on vSphere backed by vSphere Networking (VDS).

The following reference design is based on the architecture and components described in [VMware Tanzu for Kubernetes Operations Reference Architecture](index.md)
